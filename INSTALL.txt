#GraDe-A INSTALL FILE
#GraDe-A is released under GPLv3, for license details see LICENSE.txt

Installation:
This software uses CMake for Makefile-generation.
This software depends on C++11, OpenMP and either Eigen or Armadillo.
GraDe-A uses the header-only Eigen library by default.
If building with Armadillo, the Blas and Lapack libraries are required.
The installation procedure should generate an executable file in ./build/.

-------------------------
Using Eigen library:
-------------------------

Under Linux:
Open a terminal in the GraDe-A root directory.
cd ./build/
cmake ..
make

Under Windows/MSYS or Cygwin:
Open a terminal in the GraDe-A root directory.
cd ./build/
cmake .. -G"MSYS Makefiles"
make

Under Windows/Visual Studio:
Open Visual Studio Development Console in the GraDe-A root directory.
cd .\build\
cmake .. -G"NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
nmake

One can specify a custom build-type by attaching -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=build_type to the cmake-command. 
E.g. for a Debug build:
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

-------------------------
Using Armadillo library:
-------------------------

In order to compile with the Armadillo library install or build the Armadillo library and
add -DUSE_ARMADILLO=True to the cmake-command.

E.g. for Linux do:
cd ./build/
cmake .. -DUSE_ARMADILLO=True
make

To build armadillo from source do the following:

Inside ./armadillo/ do:

Under Linux:
cmake .
make

For Linux the Lapack and Blas libraries must be installed.
E.g. for Ubuntu they are installed alongside the Armadillo installation by:
sudo apt-get install libarmadillo-dev

Under Windows/MSYS or Cygwin:
cmake . -G"MSYS Makefiles"
make

Under Windows/Visual Studio:
cmake . -G"NMake Makefiles"
nmake

For Windows copy the correct Blas and Lapack library files into ./lib/.
64bit: Copy all files from ./armadillo/examples/lib_win64/ into ./lib/
32bit: Download liblapack.dll and libblas.dll from https://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-for-windows/lapack/ (Mingw section) into ./lib/
