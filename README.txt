GraDe-A: Grain Detection Algorithm
GraDe-A is a software tool, which is able to detect 3D-grain-entities from MD-simulation data.
The software currently supports fcc-strucutured materials.
The code has been developed by Paul Hoffrogge during a Masterthesis-project at IMM, RWTH-Aachen.

Install as described in INSTALL.txt.

Set number of threads with OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable.
For Windows copy dependent .dll files in the same folder as the executable.

Run the grade-A executable with proper parameters.
E.g. for an Al-dataset of the form
inputfile_1.cfg
inputfile_2.cfg
...
inputfile_x.cfg
do:

Windows:
set OMP_NUM_THREADS=8
grade-A.exe "inputfile_*.cfg" p 4.05 1.0

Linux:
OMP_NUM_THREADS=8
./grade-A "inputfile_*.cfg" p 4.05 1.0

Please write the glob-pattern with "", the corresponding files are found by the software itself.
The program generates a folder "./TimeEvo/" and writes output-files for each inputfile.
